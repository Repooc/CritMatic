## CritMatic - Your Personal Damage and Heal Tracker

CritMatic is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon designed to help players keep track of their highest critical and normal hits (both damage and heal). Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the game, CritMatic is an invaluable tool to help you understand your character's performance and potential.

### Key Features:

- **Real-time Tracking:** CritMatic monitors your combat logs in real-time and records your highest critical and normal hits for each spell you cast. It automatically updates these records when you hit harder.

- **Spell-specific Data:** The addon doesn't just track your highest hits overall; it keeps separate records for each spell you use. This allows you to see which of your abilities are hitting the hardest and how different spells compare.

- **Healing Tracking:** In addition to damage, CritMatic also tracks your healing output, recording the highest heal and critical heal for each healing spell you cast.

- **Detailed Tooltip Information:** When you mouse over a spell on your action bar, CritMatic adds additional lines to the tooltip showing your highest normal and critical hit with that spell.

- **Notification System:** CritMatic can notify you with a message and sound effect whenever you hit a new highest normal or critical hit.

- **Persistent Data:** CritMatic saves your highest hits data between sessions, so you can log out or switch characters without losing your records. You can also reset the data at any time if you want to start fresh.

- **Slash Command:** Use the `/cmreset` command to reset all your saved data. This can be useful if you want to start tracking from scratch or if you've made significant changes to your character's gear or abilities.

With CritMatic, you'll have a better understanding of your character's capabilities, and you'll always know when you've hit a new personal best. Happy Criting!
